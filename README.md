The Wells Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a clinical prediction rule used to assess the probability of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of DVT. Deep vein thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins, most commonly in the legs. It can lead to serious complications, including pulmonary embolism (PE), if the clot travels to the lungs.
